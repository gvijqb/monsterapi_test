ðŸ“Œ As a first step to build the RAG pipeline, Sign up for a Monster API account, create an LLM deployment with Monster-Deploy by simply select your desired LLM with their one-click solution.

ðŸ“Œ Once the deployment is live, you'll have an LLM API endpoint ready to handle queries within moments. This Rest API endpoint can be integrated into any public web or mobile application.

ðŸ“Œ And now, you'll receive an authentication token and URL to access the LLM endpoints. Copy the endpoint URL and authentication key

ðŸ“Œ Paste these values into their ChainLit UI-interface to set up your chat UI along with RAG and then you are good to go.

ðŸ“Œ MonsterDeploy's seamless integration with LlamaIndex provides direct access to your deployed LLMs within the LlamaIndex framework.

ðŸ“Œ This optimizes data loading and indexing, allowing efficient parsing of large document contexts. The system then sends this context to query your deployed LLM endpoints, ensuring seamless data retrieval and indexing

âœ¨ Some of the key advantages of deploying a private LLM endpoint with MonsterAPI

ðŸ“Œ Enhanced Security: Keep your model and data secure within your private endpoint, accessible only through your deploymentâ€™s auth key.

ðŸ“Œ Cost-Effectiveness: MonsterAPI is one of the most cost-effective solutions for deploying and managing LLMs by integrating their affordable GPU cloud optimised for higher throughput (vllm in the backend).

ðŸ“Œ Scalability: Your LLM deployments automatically scale bi-directionally on demand, ensuring optimal performance during peak usage.

ðŸ“Œ Customization: Tailor your LLM deployment to specific requirements, including GPU and RAM configurations. Start serving text generation requests using models like Llama2, CodeLlama, Falcon 40B or any of your custom/finetuned models.

ðŸ“Œ Advanced Monitoring: Gain insights into LLM performance and usage metrics with MonsterAPI's comprehensive monitoring and analytics features.

ðŸ“Œ Fine-tuned LLM Deployments: Monster Deploy enables you to deploy fine-tuned LLMs as API endpoints. Thus reducing the need to set up complex custom pipelines for fine-tuning and deploying LLMs at scale.
