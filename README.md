@monsterapis designed their no-code LLM fine-tuner that simplifies the process of finetuning by:

ðŸ‘‰ Automatically configuring GPU computing environments,

ðŸ‘‰ Optimizing memory usage by finding the optimal batch size,

ðŸ‘‰ Integrates experiment tracking with WandB, and

ðŸ‘‰ Auto configures the pipeline to complete without any errors on their cost-optimised GPU cloud

âœ¨ Nowhere during this entire process, did I search for GPUs.

âœ¨ I didnâ€™t have to provision the GPU server, a VM and containerise them.

âœ¨ I didnâ€™t have to setup NVIDIA drivers, libraries and the CUDA environment.

âœ¨ I just used the no-code option and got started within a minute.

âœ¨ Saved me not just a lot of time but immense frustration that generally comes up when dealing with traditional clouds for fine tuning and deployments.

ðŸ“Œ Recently, they finetuned Mistral-7B using the "no-robots" dataset and the finetuned model outperformed the base model on various benchmarks. The entire model finetuning cost was less than a cup of coffee.

The actual process for Finetuning an LLM

ðŸ“Œ Launch a Finetuning Portal, and choose from the latest Large Language Models (LLMs) such as Llama 2 7B, CodeLlama, Falcon, GPT-J 6B or X-Gen.

ðŸ“Œ Dataset Preparation: You can choose from the curated selection of mostly used hugging face datasets with predefined training prompt configuration. OR

You can use your own custom datasets, and we get a good amount of control around how the Dataset needs to be prepared in the right format. The portal provides a text-area in which target columns can be specified. Depending on the type of task chosen, you might need to alter the column names.

ðŸ“Œ Specify Hyperparameter Configuration: such as epochs, learning rate, cutoff length, warmup steps, and so on.

ðŸ“Œ Track stages of your finetuning jobs: Like, view job logs, monitor your job metrics using Weights & Biases. And finally upload model outputs to Hugging Face.

------

ðŸ“Œ Once you have finetuned an LLM on MonsterAPI, you will receive adapter weights as the final output. This adapter contains your fine-tuned modelâ€™s weights that Monster will host as an API endpoint using Monster Deploy.

ðŸ“Œ MonsterDeploy optimizes its backend operations using vLLM framework. vLLM is a rapid and user-friendly library for large language model inference and serving, notable for its state-of-the-art serving throughput.

The example code in the image, deploys the Mixtral 8x7b Chat model with GPTQ 4bit quantization with a 48GB GPU through Monster Deploy.

The Deployment will be able to serve the model as a REST API for both static and streaming token response support.

Once the deployment is live, let's query the deployed LLM endpoint:
