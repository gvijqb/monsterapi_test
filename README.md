ü§î Thinking of deploying a Large Language Model (LLM) in production with low-cost and low-complexity ‚ùì

‚ú® Monster-API may just be the answer - gateway to seamlessly deploy LLMs and docker containers on its robust GPU compute infrastructure.

‚ú® Quickly get an API endpoint that can start serving text generation requests using models like Llama2 7B, CodeLlama 34B, Falcon 40B or any of your custom/finetuned models.

‚ú® Developed with the vLLM (Variably-Large Language Models) project as its foundation, the Deploy service is optimized for high throughput.

‚ú® As per their official blog, they were able to serve Zephyr-7b, a SOTA Open source 7B param LLM, at an incredibly economical rate of $1.25/hr, serving 39K requests per hour with an average request latency of 16ms on a 24GB GPU.

And this was using Monster Deploy on GPUs such as Nvidia RTX A5000 (24GB)  and A100 (80GB).

To access Monster Deploy Beta:

Step 1: Sign up on MonsterAPI platform.
Step 2: Apply for Monster Deploy Beta. Use your organization/business email for free 30K credits.

=================================

The example code in image, deploys the Mixtral 8x7b Chat model with GPTQ 4bit quantization by using a 48GB GPU, using Monster Deploy.

The Deployment will be able to serve the model as a REST API for both static and streaming token response support.

```py
!python3 -m pip install monsterapi==1.0.2b3
# install specific beta version of client for quick serve access.

api_key = "YOUR_MONSTER_API_KEY"
from monsterapi import client as mclient
deploy_client = mclient(api_key = api_key)

}

# Launch a deployment
ret = deploy_client.deploy("llm", launch_payload)
deployment_id = ret.get("deployment_id")
print(deployment_id)
"""

     "status":"live",
     "message":"Server has started !!!",

=================================

Once the deployment is live, let's query our deployed LLM endpoint

```py
import json

status_debug = True # Just a placeholder to show possible statuses.

if status_debug:
  status_ret = deploy_client.get_deployment_status(deployment_id)
  print(status_ret)

assert status_ret.get("status") == "live", "Please wait until status is live!"

service_client  = mclient(api_key = status_ret.get("api_auth_token"),
                          base_url = status_ret.get("URL"))

payload = {
    "input_variables": {
        "prompt": "What's up?"},
    "stream": False,
    "temperature": 0.6,
    "max_tokens": 2048
}

output = service_client.generate(model = "deploy-llm", data = payload)

if payload.get("stream"):
    for i in output:
        print(i[0])
else:
    print(json.loads(output)['text'][0])
